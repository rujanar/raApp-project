Employee task tracking Web Application

This is a simple Web App that I've created for my final bootcamp project. The purpose of the app is status tracking of tasks and subtasks of employees with possibilities of creating, editing, deleting and searching tasks and updating status.

App opens with a login page. To enter use 
username: admin 
password: admin 

:)

It is in serbian (I hope to make it bilingual when I have the time). Also, authorization roles are not implemented.
